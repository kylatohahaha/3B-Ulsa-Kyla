## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

- SOA or Service Oriented Architecture is defined as a software development model that makes use of services to build a business software applications such as web applications. This architecture also defined as loosely coupled, as it interconnects, separate and reuse multiple services in creating applications that makes this architecture independent from technologies and platforms.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

Standardized service contract - this guarantees that services must maintain and stick to the same design standards.

Loose coupling - this characteristic of SOA is to create system where components were independent from each other.

Abstraction - this characteristic of SOA tends to hide the logical design details from outside where consumers can easily implement interface services.

Reusability - this characteristic of SOA makes the architecture less coss from unnecessary creating a system all over again for alteration and reform.

Autonomy - SOA interacts functionally where services are independent from other services, making autonomous access.

Statelessness - SOA provides state management qualities to support published services.

Discoverability - To promote better usage of the service, the system should provide as much information as possible and inform the user on how to interact with it properly.

Composability - this give consumers the opportunity to learn about company skills as services that may be combined to create more complex operations.

3. Define Microservices.

- Microservice is an architecture that was used by small teams and has small independent services. This architecture also operates as an independent service that hides functionality into a modular service. The architecture aims to meet the need for the features that it offers in applications.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

Improved Scalability - microservices made it easier to select appropriate tech stack for every component without stressing about incompatibility, as the services in microservices can be developed using different languages.

Better resiliency - with microservice architecture, this makes it easy to identify the failure and issues to the performance. 

Improved productivity - microservices are easier to build and maintain as the application are into smaller and independent pieces. 

Continuous integration/continuous delivery - microservices architetcure speeds up the deployment and troubleshooting process as it allow teams to test, to fix issues, to deploy and to upgrade services independently.

Optimize business functionality - customizing the requirements of each components to enhance business functionality is made simpler.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

- Similarities

Both SOA and microservices can allow teams to test, to fix issues, to deploy and to upgrade services independently. 

Both SOA and microservices are loosely coupled.

- Differences

Microservices are based on limited setting, whereas SOA is focused on sharing components. 

SOA and Microservices are differ when it comes to Reusability and Data Duplication. 

SOA, where components are being reuse to enhance efficiency. While microservices, instead of reusing of components, it duplicate the data for maintaining efficiency and independency.

6. Define Web Services.

- Web services are the services that are made available over the web. Web Services works in a way where data can be transport by using web teachnologies. These services are used with internet as a global platform for interconnecting and communicating applications. 

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.

- The benefits of web service is that, it provides availability for software, application and cloud technology that has HTTP protocol.
- It allows you to run your program code functions over the internet. For example, when you are using facebook application, facebook uses web services to verify if a user was already logged in.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.

XML-based - It records the exchanging information between websites, databases, and third-party applications. With XML, web services are allowed to transport and store data in a shareable manner. 

Coarse-grained - This web service approach avoids client information inconsistency and allows you to save resources and improve management.

Loosely Coupled - Web services supports loose connections between systems. It gives the environment an additional layer of abstraction, which increases the flexibility and adaptability of connections

Capability to be synchronous and asynchronous - Web services An API's asynchronous or synchronous behavior depends on how long it takes for data to be returned after a request. This give users the ability to request resources, data, or services in a timely or planned manner when they're made available. Applications wait for the result to be returned after requesting data.

Supports RPC - Web services supports providing services that are similar to traditional aspect. Usually, a web services is registered. Through a web service registry, customers can locate services that are suitable for what they require.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.

Service Requestor - this is the role of web service that refers to the application that is looking for interaction with a service.

Service Provider - this is the role of web service where a web service is created by the provider and made available to client applications upon request.

Service Registry - this the role of web services where data are being store in the database for application-level communication.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

Simple Object Access Protocol - SOAP is a protocol that is used for distributed application enviroments to exhange information. Transmitting the SOAP messages to the apps is  possible as long as the client and service are using the same method.

Universal Description, Discovery and Integration - UDDI operates by specifying how information about web services can be discovered and published.

Web Services Description Language - It is an XML file that provides information about the web service's external interface. A web service definition explains the interface that the web service provider offers and instructs a client on how to create a web service request.
